Ron passed through New Mexico on a recent excursion. His team captured some [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1DcFhaCCwI&t=60s) of his stop in Tucumcari, a stop that came as a surprise to one of his particularly mettlesome coachmates. 

While visting with some of his fans in the Land of Enchantment, Ron took some time to record his world famous recipe for New Mexican Green Chile Stoo. In the spirit of sharing, Ron will now share that recipe for stoo with yoo:

## Ingredients
* 3 pounds pork shoulder cut into 2 inch pieces
* 2 onions, sliced or diced (Ron likes to slice them thinly)
* A few garlic cloves, minced or smashed
* 1.5 pounds potatoes, cut into 1 or 2 inch chunks (russets or yukon golds or some combination of the two)
* 50 grams of all porpoise flour
* stock or water (Ron suggests homemade stock, although he is not above using Better than Boo-yawn)
* 1.5 pounds roasted green chiles , roughly chopped (Ron suggests Hatch chiles, but non-denominational  anaheims will do. A roasted poblano or two might be nice as well)
* Salt (Ron likes Diamond Crystal kosher salt)
* Fat (Ron likes to use Bacon drippings or pork lard, but vegetable oils will suffice)

## Instructions
1. Generously salt pork and then toss it with flour to cover all sides of pork pieces with flour
2. Heat about 2 tbsp fat in a dutch oven over medium-high heat
3. Brown pork on at least one side (Ron usually browns 2 sides) until a brown crust forms. Work in batches if necessary so as to not crown the pan and cause pork to steam. Remove pork to a bowl.
4. If there's adequate fat in the dutch oven, then throw in your onions. Add more fat if necessary. Throw in a little salt to get those potatoes to sweat.
5. Saute onion in fat until it's soft and starting to brown a bit (maybe 5 minutes)
6. Throw in your garlic and it let it cook for a minute or so
7. Toss browned pork and its juices into dutch oven with onions and garlic
8. Add stock or water to cover (but not by much, we're going for a stoo here) and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer
9. Check for salt. The stoo should taste good at this point and salt is key here. If you don't like salt or are on a reduced salt diet, please go somewhere else as Ron is a member of the salt orthodoxy. 
10. Toss in half of your green chile
11. Let stoo simmer , partially covered, for about 90 minutes (or stick it in the oven at 225 for 90 minutes)
12. Toss in your potatoes
13. Continue to cook for another 30 minutes or so until potatoes are soft, but not completely falling apart
14. Remove from heat and taste for salt
15. Eat stoo now, or let it cool and reheat tomorrow for an even better stoo.
